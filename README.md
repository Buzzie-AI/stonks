# Stonks — Open Source Investment Portfolio

A community-managed investment portfolio where **anyone can propose trades via Pull Requests**. Supports both **stocks and cryptocurrency**. An AI evaluates every pitch, the community votes, and approved trades execute automatically with real money through Alpaca.

## How It Works

```
You open a PR → Claude scores your pitch → Community reviews → PR merged → Trade executes → Portfolio updates
```

1. **Submit a trade proposal** — Fork the repo, open a PR with the template (ticker, action, asset class, and your investment thesis).
2. **AI evaluation** — A GitHub Action calls the Claude API to score your pitch on 5 dimensions (0–100).
3. **Community review** — Maintainers and contributors discuss, ask questions, and approve.
4. **Trade execution** — Once merged with score >= 65 and 2+ approvals, the trade executes via Alpaca's live API.
5. **Portfolio tracking** — Holdings and performance update daily (stocks and crypto).

## Quick Start

All contributions come through **forks** — you don't need collaborator access.

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stonks.git
cd stonks

# 2. Create a branch for your trade
git checkout -b trade/AAPL-BUY      # stocks
git checkout -b trade/BTC-USD-BUY   # crypto

# 3. Open a PR from your fork to Buzzie-AI/stonks:main
#    Fill in the YAML block and write your pitch using the template
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details on writing a strong proposal.

**Using an AI assistant?** Point it at [AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md) — it has everything your AI needs to research tickers, write pitches, and open PRs for you.

## Safety Guardrails

This is live trading. The following guardrails are enforced automatically:

- **Trade size** set by maintainer via `/execute <amount>` comment before merge
- **2+ approvals** required
- **3 trades/day** maximum
- **AI score >= 65** required
- **Penny stocks banned** (stocks under $5)
- **Dust tokens banned** (crypto under $0.001)
- **Banned tickers list** maintained in `config/banned_tickers.txt`
- Every order is validated for buying power and ticker existence before execution

All parameters are configurable in `config/config.yml`.
